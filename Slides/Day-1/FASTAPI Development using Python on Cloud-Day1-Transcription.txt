OpenAPI 

FastAPI generates a schema using OpenAPI standard for defining the APIS. 

"Schema" 

A "schema" is a definition of variables, object, class, method. But it
is an abstract description. 

API Schema
OpenAI is a specification which dictates how to define a schema of your API. 

Data Schema 

HTTP Post

@app.post()-> decorator defines an endpoint which listens for POST request 
at a specific path. 

Request body -> the data which you send through POST request in the body, unlike GET
requests where parameters are in the URL. (query parameters) 

Pydantic models -> FastAPI leverages Pydantic model as a function parameter. 
FastAPI automatically validates the incoming data and provides the clear errors if the data
is invalid. It's the data serialization and validation framework for FastAPI. 

Automatic documentation -> FastAPI generates the OpenAPI documentation includes the body schema, 
making it easier to test the API with the tools like PostMan and built-in Swagger UI. 


204 -> No content is fitting status code if the DELETE request is successful but there's no 
response body to return (no data existing to be returned in the path parameter). 

200 -> OK as you choose to return the message or the deleted items data in the response body.
