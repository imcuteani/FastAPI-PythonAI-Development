Pydantics 

1. Type hints - An annotation that specifies type of variable , a class attribute or a function parameter or return value. 

- Type hints are optional and not enforced by python but they are useful to static type checkers. The Static type checkers are external tools which reads the python code
and analyses it, validates against the error or incorrect data types, 

Type hints are from global variables, class attributes and functions but not local variables. They can be accessed using typing.get_type_hints()

2. JSON Schema - json schema is the vocabulary which enables the JSON data consistency , validity and interoperability at scale. 

3. Dataclasses, TypedDicts, TypeAdapter, validate_call -> 

a) Pydantic dataclasses - a wrapper around the standard data classes with additional validaton performed. 

b) Type Adapter - a general way for expressing the any type of FastAPI serialization and validation. This allows types like TypedDict and NamedTuple which can 
also be validated against the simple data types like integer or timedelta(datetime) 

c) BaseModel - Pydantic's own library, this owns by Pydantic and as a superclass. it helps to perform many common utilies via instance methods. 

d) validate_call -> a decorator which performs the validation while calling a function.
