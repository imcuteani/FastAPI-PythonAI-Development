Query Parameter models 

Scenario - Building with Query parameters in FastAPI using a Pydantic model for optimized 
data organization, validation, documentation & especially when there're many related 
parameters. 

Query parameter models are declared by the Pydantic model as a dependency in the path operation
function. 

Using a Pydantic model to build the Query Parameter in FastAPI 

1. Define a Pydantic model - Create a class which can inherit from pydantic.BaseModel and 
define the fields which we can declare in the query parameters, also it should include the 
their data types and default values. 

2. Use Query() and Field() for Validation/ Metadata identification: We can use 
fastapi.Query() within the pydantic.Field() to add specific data validation constraints (like 
min_length, greater than, le, pattern) 

3. Injection of the model into the endpoint function: @app.get("/<your objects/"), declare a parameterwith the 
the type of the pydantic model and set its default value to Depends() or Query().
